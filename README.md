# Gesahni

## Project Goals

Gesahni aims to provide a simple interface for converting audio to text using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). The project serves as a starting point for experimenting with speech-to-text workflows in Python.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or later
- [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- `ffmpeg` (required by Whisper for audio processing)

## Running the Application

After installing dependencies, run the main script with an audio file as input:

```bash

```

The script will output the transcribed text to the console.
